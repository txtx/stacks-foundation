## Txtx
Txtx enhances the blockchain development experience by introducing the concept of Smart Contract Runbooks. These runbooks serve as detailed guides to ensure that interactions with the blockchain, such as contract deployments and calls, are consistent and reliable. Written in declarative languages like JSON or YAML, Smart Contract Runbooks describe the necessary transactions for deploying or interacting with smart contracts in a chain-agnostic manner. This approach not only promotes standardization and composability but also enhances explainability, making the developer's job more straightforward and efficient.

By utilizing Txtx, developers can leverage these runbooks to create reproducible workflows, which are essential for maintaining robustness in blockchain operations. The Txtx toolchain also includes a dashboard that aids in the execution and monitoring of these runbooks, providing a comprehensive solution for web3 developers. This innovation addresses the current gaps in web3 developer tooling, such as the lack of standardization and composability, and paves the way for more efficient and collaborative blockchain development.

### Benefits of Smart contract Runbooks

#### Securing Operations

Runbooks are revolutionizing the way developers deploy and interact with smart contracts, replacing the traditional one-off JavaScript files. These scripts, typically executed in the terminal, require developers to handle sensitive private keys directly, posing a security risk.

With the adoption of runbooks, developers can describe the contract calls they wish to make in a structured format, and the workflow is executed through an open-source, standalone command-line interface. This interface spins up a dynamic web UI that guides developers through their operations, enhancing security by minimizing direct key manipulation.

This shift to runbooks signifies a move towards a more secure, standardized, and user-friendly approach to blockchain development. The dynamic web UI not only assists developers in performing their tasks but also provides a visual representation of the workflow, making the process more intuitive and less error-prone.

By leveraging runbooks, developers can focus on the logic and functionality of their contracts, rather than the intricacies of deployment and interaction scripts. This leads to a more efficient development process and a stronger emphasis on the core objectives of their blockchain projects.

#### Communication between Organizations

Smart Contract Runbooks facilitate seamless communication between different companies by standardizing the processes involved in smart contract operations. This standardization significantly reduces the learning curve for teams from different organizations to collaborate effectively.

Runbooks are inherently composable, meaning a runbook can incorporate and execute actions defined in another runbook. This feature is particularly beneficial for inter-company collaboration, as it allows for the sharing and reuse of predefined workflows. For instance, if Company A has a runbook for a specific blockchain operation, Company B can import and invoke Company A's runbook within their own, ensuring consistency in the execution of shared contracts.

This composability also promotes a shared understanding of the blockchain operations between partnering teams, as the runbooks act as a common language, detailing the steps and requirements in a clear, concise, and accessible manner. It eliminates the need for lengthy explanations or the risk of miscommunication, as the runbook provides a transparent and executable specification of the tasks to be performed.

Moreover, the use of runbooks can lead to more efficient onboarding of new partners, as they provide a clear guide on how to interact with the existing smart contracts. This efficiency is crucial in fast-paced environments where time and clarity are of the essence. By leveraging Smart Contract Runbooks, companies can ensure that their blockchain collaborations are robust, secure, and easily scalable, paving the way for more dynamic and productive partnerships.

#### Time to Market

Smart Contract Runbooks significantly reduce the time to market for blockchain applications by streamlining the final and often most challenging step in the development process: smart contract integration. Traditionally, after developing contracts, developers face the daunting task of deploying them and creating a user interface for interaction, which can involve writing one-off JavaScript scripts. This integration phase is critical but can extend development time by days or even weeks.

Txtx transforms this bottleneck into a swift and efficient process. Instead of laborious scripting or UI development, Txtx enables developers to define their deployment and interaction workflows with just a few lines of configuration. This approach not only saves a substantial amount of time but also reduces the complexity and potential for errors.

By simplifying the integration step, Txtx allows developers to bring their products to market much faster. They can focus on refining their smart contracts and ensuring they meet user needs, rather than getting bogged down in the intricacies of contract deployment and interaction. This efficiency is a game-changer in the competitive blockchain space, where the ability to quickly adapt and deploy can significantly impact success.

### Architecture

Txtx's architecture is meticulously designed to be chain-agnostic, ensuring its adaptability across various blockchain platforms. To support every blockchain effectively, Txtx employs a modular approach with a system of add-ons or drivers. This system allows for streamlined integration and support for new blockchains without overburdening the core repository or binary.

The add-on/driver system acts as a scalable infrastructure that can accommodate the unique requirements of different blockchains. It prevents the Txtx system from becoming bloated and unmanageable by segregating the support for each blockchain into its own discrete module. This modular design not only simplifies maintenance but also facilitates the easy addition of support for new blockchains as they emerge.

By leveraging this architecture, Txtx can provide a robust and flexible solution that caters to the evolving landscape of blockchain technology. It ensures that developers can rely on Txtx for their cross-chain development needs without worrying about compatibility issues or the sustainability of the system. This thoughtful design positions Txtx as a forward-thinking tool that can grow and adapt alongside the blockchain industry.

### Example

The example runbook provided demonstrates how Txtx can streamline the process of interacting with the BNS (Blockchain Name Service). To successfully register a name using the BNS protocol, two specific contract calls are required: name-preorder followed by name-register. These operations adhere to a commit/reveal pattern, which is strategically designed to allow users to purchase their desired names without the risk of being front-run.


```hcl
wallet "alice" "stacks::connect" {
  expected_address = "ST2JHG361ZXG51QTKY2NQCVBPPRRE2KZB1HR05NNC"
}

action "send_name_preorder" "stacks::send_contract_call" {
  description = "Send Preorder ${input.name}.${input.namespace} transaction"
  contract_id = "ST000000000000000000002AMW42H.bns"
  function_name = "name-preorder"
  function_args = [
      stacks::cv_buff(ripemd160(sha256([
        encode_hex("${input.name}.${input.namespace}"),
        encode_hex(input.salt)
      ]))),
      stacks::cv_uint(input.price), 
  ]
  signer = wallet.alice
  confirmations = 1
}

action "send_name_regiser" "stacks::send_contract_call" {
  description = "Register name"
  contract_id = "ST000000000000000000002AMW42H.bns"
  function_name = "name-register"
  function_args = [
      stacks::cv_buff(encode_hex(input.namespace)),
      stacks::cv_buff(encode_hex(input.name)),
      stacks::cv_buff(encode_hex(input.salt)),
      stacks::cv_buff(encode_hex(input.zonefile)),
  ]
  signer = wallet.alice
  confirmations = 1
  depends_on = [action.send_name_preorder.tx_id]
}
```

#### Discussion
In this runbook, we observe the presence of 1 `wallet` and 2 `actions`. With 30 lines of configuration code, we are creating a runbook that will assist developers:
- ensuring that a `name-preorder` contract-call is being signed by `ST2JHG361ZXG51QTKY2NQCVBPPRRE2KZB1HR05NNC` through a web wallet compatible with `connect`
- wait for 1 confirmation, then
- ensuring that a `name-register` contract-call is being signed by `ST2JHG361ZXG51QTKY2NQCVBPPRRE2KZB1HR05NNC` through a web wallet compatible with `connect`

By using Txtx, developers can eliminate the manual effort involved in orchestrating contract-calls, reducing the potential for errors and ensuring a smoother, more secure registration process. 

This example highlights the practicality and efficiency of Txtx in managing complex blockchain operations, ultimately contributing to a more user-friendly experience in the blockchain domain.
